This exercise took really long to do. I really hate typing out stuff and putting
it into the console. Is there like a text editor for SQL with a color scheme. I 
think that would make it alot easier to write SQL statements.  We had a lot of 
problems figuring what we tpyed wrong when the SQL statements we inputted didn't
create what we wanted.  Reading syntax with color scheme is really difficult.  The
amount of time it took to create each entry for every single customer took forever.
Is there a faster way than manually creating a single SQL statement for eachh 
individual user?  I just really feel like there is more to learn, when it comes to
writing efficient code for SQL  I didn't really enjoy this excerise and cerating
ten entries seemed overkill.  This was definitely a tedious exercise.  At least now
I feel more competent with writing simple SQL statements.
