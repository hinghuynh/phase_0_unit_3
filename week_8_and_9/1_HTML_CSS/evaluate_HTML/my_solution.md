## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
```
Things that this site does well include: closing all tags, all tags being in 
lower case, and separating CSS into a separate file.  Things that they did 
that were not best practice include white spaces all removed, no Doctype 
declared, inline styling, poor responsive design.
```
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 
```
IDs and Classes were used properly, but more could have been created to handle
all the inline styling that done in the HTML file.
```
Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
```
Yes, i like the way they used HTML tags.  Tags were properly formatted through 
open and close tags and were all in lowercase.
``` 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or separate 
it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
```
They did both. Some of the CSS styling was done in a separate CSS file, however 
of the styling was done inline on the HTML page. 
``` 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?
```
I didn't really understand how the voting algorithm and the necessary coding 
necessary injunction to the order of how the pages were displayed.
```
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
``` 
The CSS file was DRYL, I used prettify to make it properly formatted, as it 
originally non-formatted.  Again, more of the inline styling could have been
put into the CSS file.
``` 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
```
There isn't much responsive design incorporated into the site.  Only thing 
that was responsive design friendly was the table proportions, which were set
in percentages.
```
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?
```
Given how long the HTML file is, I can see why the author chose to save
whitespace to make this page load as efficiently as possible.  People, who 
like to read news, want fast access and reliability, so this makes sense. 
However given this day in-age it would be nice to see some better styling on a
site and more responsive design for more device capability.
```
#Reflection

When i copied the HTML text off the site, I was very intimidated by the length of the code. It took me a while to figure out what to use to sort out the formatting of the text.  Prettify is an amazing. Unlike, javascript and ruby where reading actually program code can be intimidating and a foreign language. HTML is pretty reading as almost all the syntax were very simplistic and quite repetitive, despite it's ridiculous length.  Trying to reading HTML and CSS is always tedious, but it's something I need to work on.
