// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution

// I don't really know how to refactor this anymore.  The loops seem pretty
// efficient, but I might look at other people's solutions later.  I could work on 
// the var names, but I feel they're good enough to get the gist of position of 
// elements I'm referencing too. If I were to do that I would created a var name
// candidateTallyCount = votes[voter][office].  I'd really like to be able to get rid
// the if/else statement in the first loop. I know in Ruby i could do += 1 on an nonexisting
// key[value] in a hash, but it doesn't seem like I can do that in Javascript. 


// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// This was a difficult exercise. It took quite a long time to figure out how to
// put names of candidates into vote count. The logic of the loops were not too
// difficult to figure out, but because I'm so use to be able to call methods on
// hashes in ruby, it's difficult to get out of that mindset and just use pure loops
// to get the desire result.  If this votes modified array had more levels, it really
// would have been nightmarish.  These few javascript exercises really gave me a appreciate
// for the  language of Ruby. Not only is it way more elegant, but hashes and arrays
// are built out significantly more in Ruby.  In Javascript, if an array has more than
// one level of elements, it seems to lose its ability to call any methods from the 
// array class.
