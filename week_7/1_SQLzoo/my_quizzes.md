### Reflection

# This was a very long and boring exercise. THe format of the quizes were really 
# difficult.  It felt like I was trying to debug someone else's code, which I find
# extremely difficult, since I didn't write it myself. Another thing that I got 
# stuck on was the question #8 from SELECT from Nobel. I spent quite a bit of time 
# on this and eventually skipped around and got to the Nobel Quiz, which pretty 
# much had the answer in one of the questions. SQL is very different, I like that
# there's logic to it, but honestly doing SQL work seems very boring.  I still don't
# really feel comfortable with SQL  I didn't really enjoy anything in this challenge.
# The whole exercise was tedious.
