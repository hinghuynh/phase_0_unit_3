## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

This is a schema for movie and theaters

This is a schema for customers and orders for In and Out Burgers

## Release 5: Reflection
This exercise was pretty self-explainatory, pretty much all I had to do was replicate
what the examples were shown using SQL designer. SQL designer as a program was fairly
simple to use. The only difficult I had was thinking of my own schemas. What I originally
thought to be a simple idea for a schema, easily could be complciated.  Now I have a 
better idea how much data some sites actually store.  Creating a schema for In and Out
Burgers was pretty fun. The exercises got pretty repetitive after doing a couple thou.
